# Optimization CW 2
## Transport Cost Optimization
- Solved a transport cost minimization problem of the form below using the Weiszfeld Method

$$  \min_{\vec{x} \epsilon R^2} \left[ f(\vec{x}) \equiv \sum^{4}_{i=1} || \vec{x} - \vec{a}_i||_2\right] $$
- Showed the best position for an assebly line to be build if it wants to minimize fuel costs between four factories (anchor points) when:
  - Fuel cost was proportional to Euclidian distance
  - Cost (weight) varied between the anchor points
## Newtons Method for Minimization
- Found a minimizer of a 4D function by building an algorithm for Pure Newtons Method
- Ran it with a stopping criteria to find an optimal point
